    <h1>Our Commitment</h1>
    <p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold; margin-bottom:20px;">
      Masjid Al-Tawheed<br>
      A Ministry Established in Faith, Governed by Principle
    </p>

    <h2>Ministry Stewardship Pledge</h2>

    <h3>Preamble</h3>
    <p>
      We, the stewards, trustees, and faithful workers of Masjid Al-Tawheed, do solemnly affirm our commitment to operate this ministry in righteousness, transparency, and service — never for personal gain or worldly fame, but in full submission to the calling entrusted to us.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Purpose Over Profit</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Reject all forms of commercial entanglement that would compromise the sacred mission.</li>
      <li>Refrain from using ministry structures for personal enrichment, vanity, or empire-building.</li>
      <li>Ensure every asset, credit, or possession under ministry care is spiritually purposed, not personally exploited.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Transparency Over Secrecy</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Maintain clear, written records of ministry activity — including spiritual credits, trust movements, and board decisions.</li>
      <li>Answer questions of stewardship with honest accountability.</li>
      <li>Honor the trust of those who give, serve, or stand with the ministry by being open about how resources are used.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Stewardship Over Ownership</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>See ourselves not as owners, but as stewards of sacred assignments.</li>
      <li>Treat ministry property — land, vehicles, homes, funds, or creative assets — as tools of service, not trophies of success.</li>
      <li>Document the ministry’s use of all material items and spiritual assignments in alignment with ecclesiastical jurisdiction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Service Over Status</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep humility and servant-leadership at the center of governance.</li>
      <li>Avoid titles, appearances, or messaging that glorify individuals above the message.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Faith Over Fear</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Stand boldly under the protections of the First Amendment and ecclesiastical law.</li>
      <li>Resist intimidation or coercion that seeks to compromise ministry sovereignty.</li>
      <li>Act in confidence that spiritual duty outweighs worldly threats or pressures.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. Principle Over Popularity</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Uphold righteousness even when it conflicts with cultural trends or convenience.</li>
      <li>Value truth above applause, correction above comfort, and long-term legacy above short-term gain.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>7. Eternal Legacy Over Temporal Success</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Invest in works that endure beyond personal lifetimes.</li>
      <li>Train future generations of faithful stewards through teaching, example, and mentorship.</li>
      <li>Ensure ministry resources build a spiritual inheritance, not fleeting recognition.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>8. Accountability Before God</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Recognize that all ministry work is accountable to the Most High above all human systems.</li>
      <li>Accept correction from Scripture, conscience, and the collective body of faithful believers.</li>
      <li>Remain steadfast in prayer, fasting, and worship as the foundation of stewardship.</li>
    </ul>
