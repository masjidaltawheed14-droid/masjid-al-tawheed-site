      <h2>Welcome to Masjid Al-Tawheed</h2>
      <p>
        We are a faith-based ministry operating under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction and spiritual mandate of the Most High. This website serves as our official digital record, notice center, and governance portal.

      <h2>Ecclesiastical Declaration</h2>
      <p>
        Masjid Al-Tawheed operates solely under the jurisdiction of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and the international protections afforded to religious ministries and assemblies. We neither seek nor require recognition by any external authority to carry out our spiritual mission.
      </p>

      <h3>🌍 Ecclesiastical and International Legal Protections</h3>

      <h4>United States Constitution – First Amendment</h4>
      <p><em>“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof…”</em><br>
      Masjid Al-Tawheed operates under the sacred protections of the First Amendment as a faith-based ministry. All activities, documents, and operations are shielded from government interference, taxation, and licensing when functioning within this protected ecclesiastical jurisdiction.</p>

      <h4>26 U.S. Code § 508(c)(1)(A) – Mandatory Exceptions</h4>
      <p><em>“New organizations, churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associations of churches are excepted from having to apply for recognition of exemption…”</em><br>
      This ministry is automatically considered tax-exempt under federal law and is not required to file Form 1023 or seek IRS approval. Our exemption is based in law, not application.</p>

      <h4>The Hague Convention of 1961</h4>
      <p>This international treaty protects religious and private organizations from forced jurisdictional entanglements by foreign or domestic governments. It affirms the legal validity of apostilled or sealed documents without the need for further authentication.</p>

      <h4>The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969)</h4>
      <p>This global treaty safeguards the right of nations, peoples, and spiritual bodies to enter into private agreements and to remain sovereign in their affairs. It affirms that agreements made under mutual consent cannot be violated by external parties.</p>

      <h4>United Nations Charter – Articles 18–20</h4>
      <p>These articles affirm the equal voting rights and participation of all member states, protect self-determination of peoples, and prohibit coercion or forced compliance with external jurisdictions. The rights of indigenous, religious, and cultural bodies are protected under these international standards.</p>
